# React Mini-Blog Project

## Date: 11/14+15 and W12 D4+5 D56+57

### Summary

This was our first time integrating the full stack. Inside this repo, I have an express api and a react-blog folder. The react blog renders the json data different ways from the express api depending on different actions the user takes.

It's unstyled at this point. I had more fun with the Express/Postgres side of development.
